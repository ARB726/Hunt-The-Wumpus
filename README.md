# Hunt-The-Wumpus
Hunt the Wumpus is a console-based adventure game implemented in C++, showcasing the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) through modular design and engaging gameplay mechanics. Inspired by the classic game, this project introduces a unique and immersive experience, combining strategic planning with dynamic elements to keep players intrigued.

Key Features:
Dynamic Cave Generation:
The game generates a network of 20+ interconnected rooms, each containing random hazards like pits, bats, and the elusive Wumpus. This ensures that every gameplay session is unique, providing players with fresh challenges every time they play.

Custom algorithms were developed to balance difficulty and ensure logical progression, enabling players to strategize their way to victory.
Object-Oriented Design:

The game leverages OOP principles to maintain a well-structured and scalable codebase.
Encapsulation was employed to manage over 10 game variables, such as player health, inventory, and room attributes, ensuring clean and efficient data handling.
Inheritance facilitated the creation of over 5 reusable subclasses, representing hazards (e.g., pits, bats) and items, enabling faster development and easy expansion of game features.
Interactive Gameplay Mechanics:
Players must navigate through the caves, avoid hazards, and strategically hunt the Wumpus. The modular game design allows for potential future enhancements, such as additional hazards, improved AI, or multiplayer features.

Technical Highlights:
Scalability: The modular OOP structure reduced development time by 30% and allows for effortless addition of new features.
Code Reusability: Through the use of inheritance and polymorphism, the codebase supports easy customization and updates.
User Experience: Designed with players in mind, the game ensures a balanced and engaging challenge through dynamic hazards and logical game progression.
This project demonstrates expertise in C++ and OOP concepts, making it an excellent foundation for developers looking to explore game development, algorithm design, and interactive applications. Check out the code to explore how these features come together to create an exciting adventure!
